# Invoice Keeper and Analytics

This is a NestJS REST API for an application that enables the extraction and storing of invoice data. It uses the GCloud AutoML service in order to predict and extract information from a text string.

## Description

The project was created out of curiousity for what may be achieved using the GCloud AutoML service and in order to easily store and later view the anayltics for all my invoices. The application when complete (Analytics still missing) will have a mobile app component to it in order to take pictures of invoices and easily extract important data and visualize different data such as which items I mostly buy and how much I spend on a monthly basis on items by category and other analytics data points.
